# Introduction

Laravel Zero was created by, and is maintained by **[Nuno Maduro](https://github.com/nunomaduro)**, and is
a micro-framework that provides an elegant starting point for your console application. It is an **unofficial**
and customized version of Laravel optimized for building command-line applications.

It’s built on top of the latest release of Laravel, the most popular PHP web framework. Using Laravel Zero, you are free to take
advantage of Laravel's core great features, and at the same time leverage minimal application structure and a lightweight experience.

Laravel Zero is **100% open source**, so you’re free to dig through the source to see exactly how it works. See something that needs to be improved? Just send us a [pull request on GitHub](https://github.com/laravel-zero).
