# Tinker REPL

Laravel includes a powerful REPL, called Tinker, powered by the PsySH console
by Justin Hileman under the hood. The tinker console allows you to interact
with your Laravel application from the command line in an interactive shell.

[Jorge Gonz√°lez](https://github.com/scrubmx) made it available for Laravel Zero. Get more details: [https://github.com/intonate/tinker-zero](https://github.com/intonate/tinker-zero).
